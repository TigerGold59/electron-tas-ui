# electron-tas-ui
User interface for editing, compiling, and exporting hamhub7/nx-TAS scripts for use on the Switch.

## Current State - Highly incomplete
Can't edit scripts in-application. Pretty much the only thing you can do is compile and export them.

## TODO
- **BETTER APPLICATION NAME**
- Add in-app text editing field
- Add functional editing UI
- Add compile & export functionality
- Fix light mode look
- Make windows look actually decent on Windows
- Fix issue where since the backup directory isn't made, exporting to the Switch throws an error
