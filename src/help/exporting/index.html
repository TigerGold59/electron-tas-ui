      Overview
    </h2>
    <p>
      By using the in-app <b>File → Export Existing Script</b> or any of the
      options that include exporting, you can quickly and easily transfer TAS
      script files from your computer to your Switch. This requires a few
      things, though:<br /><br />
      1. You must have
      <a href="https://github.com/cathery/sys-ftpd-light">sys-ftpd-light</a>
      installed and enabled, a sysmod for your Switch that turns it into an FTP
      server. This is needed so that your computer can exchange files.<br />
      2. Your Switch must be on the same Wi-Fi network as your computer.<br />
      3. You must have a folder called "scripts" on the main directory of your
      SD card.
      <br /><br />
      Once you have met these requirements, go to the
      <b>Settings → Internet</b> menu on your Switch. Scroll down and find the
      IP address field. This is what you must input on the "Switch's local IP
      address" box in the export window. From here, you can export and the app
      will backup whatever files it overwrites, in case you need them later.<br /><br />
      <b><em>NOTE</em></b
      >: Your Switch's IP address will probably change after restarting, and
      will change any time you switch Wi-Fi networks.
