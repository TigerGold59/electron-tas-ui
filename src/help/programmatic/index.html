      Overview
    </h2>
    <p>
      Programmatic Scripts lets you control a TAS with the JavaScript
      programming language. You can then compile it into an
      <a href="https://github.com/hamhub7/nx-TAS">nx-TAS</a>- or
      <a href="https://github.com/sorenbug/sys-script">sys-script</a>-readable
      format using the <b>File â†’ Compile JavaScript to TAS Script</b> option.
    </p>
    <h3>
      How to Use
    </h3>
    <p>
      To start, create a JavaScript file. The script will be run using the
      Node.js runtime, so you can do all the things you could normally do with that.
      The file will need to have a function as its
      <code>module.exports</code>.<br />
      This function will take 1 argument (here we will call it controller, though
      it can be named anything), and return the same controller object later.
      Here are the methods the controller has, which will create your TAS
      script:
      <br /><br>
      <code>controller.press(["list", "of", "btns", "KEY_A"])</code>: This will
      press the listed buttons on the controller. It also accepts a single
      button with no array wrapper.
      <br /><hr>
      <code>controller.release(["list", "of", "btns", "KEY_B"])</code>: This
      method releases the listed buttons if they are pressed. It also accepts a
      single button with no array wrapper.
      <br /><br>
      <em><b>NOTE</b></em
      >: Both of the above functions have a variant (<code>press_all</code> or
      <code>release_all</code>) that accepts no argument and presses or releases
      all buttons. <br /><hr>
      <code>controller.frames(integer)</code>: This advances the frame by the
      number passed as an argument.
      <br /><hr>
      <code>controller.set_lstick/set_rstick(angle, magnitude)</code>: This sets
      the stick position to the angle and magnitude specified. Both are forced
      to integers and magnitude is coerced between -32767-32767.
      <br />
    </p>
    <h3>
      How it Works
    </h3>
    <p>
      Inside the JavaScript to TAS compiler, the script you type is passed to <code>require()</code> which then gives the compiler the function which you made.
      A controller object is then initialized and passed to that function. After that, the returned controller's method <code>controller.createUpdateFrames()</code> is run,
      which converts the controller object's internal frame queue to the same format a Better Scripts file is parsed into. The compiler then runs the same
      code it normally does to create the finished script.<br>
      You can find the source code on GitHub <a href="https://github.com/TigerGold59/electron-tas-ui/blob/master/src/assets/compiling/js_maker.ts">here</a>.

      If there's something you don't understand, you should experiment and look
      at the compiled output. If you're still confused about something, you can
