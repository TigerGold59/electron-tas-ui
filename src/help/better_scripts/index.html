    <h2>
      Overview
    </h2>
    <p>
      Better Scripts aims to provide an easier way of writing TAS scripts for
      the Switch by adding a few features. You can write a script in the Better
      Scripts format (listed below), then compile it into an
      <a href="https://github.com/hamhub7/nx-TAS">nx-TAS</a>- or
      <a href="https://github.com/sorenbug/sys-script">sys-script</a>-readable
      format using the <b>File → Compile Script</b> option.
    </p>
    <h3>
      Line Formatting
    </h3>
    <p>
      In a Better Scripts file, each line starts with the number of frames to
      wait from the line before it. The exception is the first line, which
      should start with <b>+</b>. After that, you can choose from a number of
      parameters separated by spaces which will do different things to the
      controller:<br /><br />
      <b>ON</b>: This presses the buttons specified on the controller. They will
      not be released until they are turned off by another parameter.<br />
      <code class="block">
        + ON{KEY_A,KEY_B}
      </code>
      Note that no spaces are allowed in between the brackets, as the compiler
      uses spaces to decide what parameters there are.
      <br />
      <hr />
      <b>OFF</b>: This works exactly the same as <b>ON</b>, but releases the
      buttons instead.<br />
      <code class="block">
        + ON{KEY_ZL} <br />
        1 ON{KEY_Y} <br />
        5 OFF{KEY_ZL,KEY_Y}
      </code>
      The above script presses ZL, then presses Y the next frame, then waits 4
      frames, then releases both of them.
      <br />
      <hr />
      <b>RAW</b>: This parameter releases all other buttons on the controller,
      only pressing the ones specified. They are still not turned off until you
      release them, however.<br />
      <code class="block">
        + ON{KEY_X,KEY_Y,KEY_A,KEY_B} <br />
        5 RAW{KEY_PLUS}
      </code>
      The script shown above will press X, Y, A, and B, wait 4 frames, then
      release all of them and only press plus.
      <br />
      <hr />
      <b>LSTICK/RSTICK</b>: This parameter sets the position of the control
      stick (left or right). It takes two numbers: the angle from straight
      forward (going clockwise), and how many units (from 0-32767, but the
      compiler will coerce into that range).<br />
      <code class="block">
        + ON{KEY_A} LSTICK{0,15000} <br />
        10 LSTICK{180,15000} RSTICK{0,32767}
      </code>
      The script shown above will press A and set the left control stick halfway
      going forward, wait 9 frames, reverse the direction of the left stick,
      then set the right stick all the way forward.
    </p>
    <h3>
      Variables
    </h3>
    <p>
      You can declare a variable like this:
      <code class="block">
        VAL FORWARD = 0,32767
      </code>
      Then, later in the code, you can get the variable value by using <code>$</code> before the name of the variable:
      <code class="block">
        + LSTICK{$FORWARD}
      </code>
      The compiler will evaluate macros before it evaluates variables.
    </p>
    <h3>
      Macros
    </h3>
    <p>
      Macros are a feature that let you store repeated sequences of lines and
      use them in an easier way. You can define a macro like this:
      <code class="block">
        DEF DIVE {<br />
        1 ON{KEY_ZL}<br />
        1 ON{KEY_Y}<br />
        }
      </code>
      You should avoid using <b>RAW</b> in macros since it may interrupt the
      script outside by turning all other keys off.<br />
      You can invoke a macro simply by making the only contents of the line the
      name of a macro, like so:
      <code class="block">
        + LSTICK{0,32767}<br />
        DIVE
      </code>
      You can also invoke a macro with a more complicated syntax, which allows you to add things to the contents. It goes like this:
      <code class="block">
        + LSTICK{0,32767}<br />
        DIVE&lt1:LSTICK{180,32767}&gt
      </code>
      The first thing inside the arrows is the line number and the second is the content to add.
      If you want to add things on multiple lines, you can do multiple by separating the sets with <code>-</code>.
      You must define a macro in the same file you use it in.<br /><br />
      <b><em>NOTE:</em></b> When the compiler sees an invocation, it just
      replaces the invocation with the contents of the macro, so be careful.
    </p>
    <h4>
      Built-in Macros
    </h4>
    <p>
      The compiler ships with built-in macros for certain games which you can
      include like this:
      <code class="block">
        BUILTINS SMO
      </code>
      This line will import the built-in macros from Super Mario Odyssey for use
      in your script. A list of built-in macros is available at the <b>Help → Built-in Macros</b> page.
    </p>
